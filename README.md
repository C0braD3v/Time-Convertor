# Time Convertor
This was a super simple GO script I wrote to convert a timestamp to different formats and types, such as UNIX, ISO, RFC1123, and more. I made this program originally because some of the staff members on a team i'm involved with always complained about me giving the time in UTC 24h clock (Used to using this as it's the standard for time in programming), so i decided to do a bit of trolling, and start giving them meeting times and such in UNIX, or ISO, and created this script so I could get the values quickly. I've included the GO code, as well as the executable binary file for anyone who wants to download the script without downloading GO.
